## Style Guide

File names should be meaningful and end in .R, .do, or .py, respectively. Avoid using special characters in file names - stick with numbers, letters, -, and \_.

If files should be run in a particular order, prefix them with numbers. If it seems likely youâ€™ll have more than 10 files, left pad with zero:

Variable and function names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and _. Use underscores (_) (so called snake case) to separate words within a name.

Data files should follow the above conventions.
